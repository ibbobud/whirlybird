# Current Task Status

## Problem Description [RESOLVED]
Previous issues with Next.js searchParams handling in the root page component have been resolved:

1. ✓ Fixed asynchronous access to searchParams.bay by wrapping in Promise
2. ✓ Fixed asynchronous access to searchParams.flightline by wrapping in Promise
3. ✓ Fixed URL parsing for bay data fetching
4. ✓ Implemented proper async/await pattern for searchParams handling

## Implementation Details

### Current Working Implementation
- Page component is properly async
- searchParams are handled asynchronously in getBayData() using Promise.resolve()
- Excel file reading is implemented correctly with proper error handling
- Comprehensive type safety with TypeScript
- Proper loading states with Suspense boundary

```typescript
type Props = {
  searchParams: { [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }
}

type BayResult = 
  | { error: 'missing-params' }
  | { error: 'bay-not-found'; bayNumber: number; flightline: number }
  | { bay: { 
      bayNumber: number;
      flightline: number;
      rank: number;
      serialNumber: string;
      customerName: string;
      urls: string[];
    }}
```

## Latest Changes
- Modified getBayData to accept searchParams as a Promise
- Added proper await for resolving searchParams before accessing properties
- Updated Home component to pass searchParams as Promise.resolve(searchParams)
- Verified working with test URL /?bay=1&flightline=1

## Verification Complete
✓ All searchParams errors are resolved
✓ Excel file reading functionality is working
✓ Error handling covers all edge cases
✓ Data flow from Excel to UI components is validated
✓ Tested with actual URL parameters

## Previous Steps Completed
1. ✓ Reverted to Excel-based approach
2. ✓ Maintained proper typing for searchParams
3. ✓ Implemented comprehensive error handling
4. ✓ Added proper loading states
5. ✓ Fixed async handling of searchParams

## Current Status
All identified issues have been resolved. The implementation:
- Handles searchParams correctly and asynchronously using Promises
- Properly reads data from Excel file
- Includes comprehensive error handling
- Maintains type safety throughout
- Uses appropriate loading states with Suspense
- Successfully tested with URL parameters

No outstanding issues remain to be addressed.
