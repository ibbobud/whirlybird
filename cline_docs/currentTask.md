# Current Task Status

## Problem Description
We encountered errors related to Next.js searchParams handling in the root page component:

1. Error accessing `searchParams.bay` synchronously
2. Error accessing `searchParams.flightline` synchronously
3. Error with URL parsing when attempting to fetch bay data

## Recent Changes Made

### 1. Initial API-based Approach
- Attempted to modify the page component to use an API endpoint
- Added TypeScript interfaces for searchParams
- Made the Home component async
- Added Suspense boundary for loading states
- This approach failed due to URL parsing errors

### 2. Reverted to Excel-based Approach
- Restored the original Excel file reading implementation
- Maintained proper typing for searchParams
- Kept error handling and type safety
- Preserved Suspense boundary for loading states

## Current Implementation
```typescript
type Props = {
  searchParams: { [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }
}

type BayResult = 
  | { error: 'missing-params' }
  | { error: 'bay-not-found'; bayNumber: number; flightline: number }
  | { bay: { 
      bayNumber: number;
      flightline: number;
      rank: number;
      serialNumber: string;
      customerName: string;
      urls: string[];
    }}
```

The implementation reads data directly from Excel using `readExcelFile()` instead of making API calls.

## Next Steps
1. Verify that the searchParams errors are resolved
2. Test the Excel file reading functionality
3. Ensure proper error handling for all edge cases
4. Validate the data flow from Excel to UI components

## Outstanding Issues
1. Need to confirm if searchParams errors are fully resolved
2. Need to verify Excel data reading performance
3. May need to implement caching for Excel data to improve performance
